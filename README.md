<h4>VERY OLD bash project:)</h4>

One of the first projects I did while learning Bash.

Shows current date & time, calendar (with option to add notes), delete files on the system and display information about your system. Works on older versions of MacOS and Linux. Using Dialog GUI.

How to run this project:
1) Download files
2) Open terminal
3) Navigate to folder where you saved files
4) Type "bash main.sh"
5) Enjoy
